## The Rules of Pig Solitaire
In 7 turns, you are attempting to get the highest score possible.

Each turn, you have two choices:

Roll. Roll a six-sided die. If it comes up one, your turn is over and you add nothing to your score. If it comes up two through six, you add that number to your turn total and choose again.

Hold. If you hold, you add the turn total to your score.

Every turn, you will always roll first, else you will have no turn total to add to your score.


## test_pig.py
Heavily modified test suite. After pig.py was refactored to be simpler, many methods and attributes tested in test_pig.py were no longer required. Therefore most tests have been commented out until they can be repurposed.
